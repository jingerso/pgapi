## User Guide

- [Developer Install](https://github.com/jingerso/pgchamp/#developer-install)
- [Configuring Server Connections](https://github.com/jingerso/pgchamp/#configuring-server-connections)

## Developer Install

**Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 4 on your machine**.

**We strongly recommend to use Node >= 6 and npm >= 3 for faster installation speed and better disk usage.** You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

Clone the repository

````sh
$ git clone git@github.com:jingerso/pgchamp.git
$ cd pgchamp
````

Install Dependancies
````sh
$ npm i && cd client && npm i
````

Start the API Service
````sh
$ export PORT=9000
$ ./node_modules/babel-cli/bin/babel-node.js src/server.js
````

Start the client
````sh
$ cd client && npm start
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The client app will automatically reload when you save code edits.

The client is based on [React Create App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It has extensive documentation and support [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Configuring Server Connections

````sh
$ cd pgchamp
$ touch servers.json
````

servers.json has the following format:

````json
[
  {
    "name": "Server #1",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "5432",
    "username": "postgres",
    "password": ""
  },
  {
    "name": "Server #2",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "5432",
    "username": "postgres",
    "password": ""
  }
]
````

The API server will require a restart after modifying servers.json:
````sh
$ ./node_modules/babel-cli/bin/babel-node.js src/server.js
````
